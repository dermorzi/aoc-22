# Advent of code 2022

These are my solutions for the advent of code challenges in 2022. For all code executions, there are no external dependencies required.

For the results of all days run this command:

```bash
npm start
```

For the results of a specific day run this command:

```bash
# in this case the challenge of day 1
npm run challenge 01
```
